# quite-snap
QuietSnap is a macOS utility that auto-resizes newly launched app windows to an almost-maximized layout. It uses Accessibility APIs (no hotkeys needed), respects visible screen space, supports adjustable horizontal margin with fixed vertical padding, and works as a lightweight SwiftUI desktop app.
